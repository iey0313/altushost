# AltusHost Premium European Hosting: 45-Day Money Back, 99.9% Uptime, Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure

So you're shopping for web hosting and stumbled upon AltusHost. Smart move – but let me guess, you're wondering if it's actually worth the slightly higher price tag compared to those budget hosts flooding your inbox with $2.99/month offers?

Here's the thing: AltusHost isn't trying to be the cheapest option. They're the hosting equivalent of that reliable friend who actually shows up when they say they will. Since 2008, they've been quietly building a reputation in Europe for doing hosting the right way – with their own hardware, multiple data centers, and support that doesn't make you want to throw your laptop out the window.

## What Makes AltusHost Different (And Why It Matters)

Most hosting companies are basically resellers. They rent servers from bigger providers, slap their logo on it, and call it a day. AltusHost? They own their hardware. They control their network. When something breaks, they don't have to wait for some third party to fix it.

Based in Amsterdam, they operate data centers across five European locations: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Bulgaria, and Serbia. All facilities hold ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 certifications, meaning they meet international standards for quality and security. For businesses dealing with GDPR compliance or serving European audiences, this is gold.

The company's been around since 2008 – not a dinosaur, but old enough to have figured out what works. Over 10,000 customers trust them with everything from small business websites to enterprise-grade dedicated servers.

## The Hosting Plans: What You Actually Get

### Business Web Hosting (Shared Hosting)

AltusHost's shared hosting runs on some serious tech: LiteSpeed Web Servers (faster than Apache), CloudLinux OS (prevents resource hogging from other sites on your server), and cPanel for easy management.

| Plan | Storage | Websites | Price/Month | Key Features | Get Started |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **BIZ 20** | 10GB SSD | 2 sites | €9.00 | Unlimited bandwidth, Free SSL, Daily backups |  [Order Now](https://altushost.com/web-hosting/) |
| **BIZ 50** | 20GB SSD | 5 sites | €12.00 | Everything in BIZ 20 + More storage |  [Order Now](https://altushost.com/web-hosting/) |
| **BIZ 100** | 30GB SSD | 10 sites | €16.00 | Everything above + Maximum storage |  [Order Now](https://altushost.com/web-hosting/) |

All plans include unlimited MySQL databases, unlimited email accounts, free website migration, and a website builder. The standout feature? A 45-day money-back guarantee – that's 15 days longer than the industry standard.

Worth noting: These are annual plans. No monthly billing for shared hosting, which is actually pretty standard for quality European hosts.

### VPS Hosting: When You Need More Control

Virtual Private Servers from AltusHost use KVM virtualization, giving you dedicated resources that won't fluctuate when other users spike their usage. You get full root access, choice of Linux or Windows, and can reboot remotely without contacting support.

| Plan | CPU | RAM | Storage | Bandwidth | Price/Month | Server Location | Get Started |
|------|-----|-----|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **SX1** | 2 cores | 2GB | 40GB SSD | 4TB | €15.00 | NL/SE/BG/CH |  [Order VPS](https://altushost.com/linux-vps/) |
| **SX2** | 3 cores | 4GB | 80GB SSD | 8TB | €30.00 | NL/SE/BG/CH |  [Order VPS](https://altushost.com/linux-vps/) |
| **SX3** | 4 cores | 6GB | 120GB SSD | 12TB | €60.00 | NL/SE/BG/CH |  [Order VPS](https://altushost.com/linux-vps/) |
| **SX4** | 6 cores | 8GB | 160GB SSD | 16TB | €90.17 | NL/SE/BG/CH |  [Order VPS](https://altushost.com/linux-vps/) |

VPS plans come with a 14-day money-back guarantee. cPanel or DirectAdmin can be added for €5.64 to €28.20/month depending on your needs.

One thing users love: easy vertical scaling. Need more RAM next month? Add it. Realize you're paying for resources you don't use? Scale down. Most hosts make this process painful – AltusHost makes it simple.

### Dedicated Servers: The Heavy Hitters

For serious operations, AltusHost offers three tiers of dedicated servers: Standard, High-End, and Outlet (budget-friendly refurbished hardware).

**Outlet Servers** (starting at €107.15/month): Older hardware that still performs well, perfect for testing environments or non-critical workloads.

**Standard Servers** (starting at €149/month): Current-generation Intel processors, ideal for most business applications.

**High-End Servers** (starting at €338.30/month): Powerhouses with dual Intel Xeon processors and massive RAM configurations. For example, their HE-2 model comes with dual Xeon E5 2650 v3 processors, 96GB RAM, and 8TB storage for €338.30/month – actually a solid price-to-performance ratio for enterprise hardware.

Need a custom configuration? Their sales team will spec out a server that matches your exact requirements. 👉 [Explore dedicated servers](https://altushost.com/dedicated-servers/)

### Reseller Hosting: For Agencies and Developers

White-label reseller hosting powered by WHM/cPanel, starting at €29/month. Manage multiple client sites from one dashboard, with all the billing and provisioning tools you need to run a hosting business.

| Plan | Storage | cPanel Accounts | Price/Month | Get Started |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Reseller 50** | 50GB SSD | Up to 25 | €29.00 |  [Start Reselling](https://altushost.com/reseller-web-hosting/) |
| **Reseller 100** | 100GB SSD | Up to 50 | €48.00 |  [Start Reselling](https://altushost.com/reseller-web-hosting/) |
| **Reseller 150** | 150GB SSD | Up to 75 | €72.00 |  [Start Reselling](https://altushost.com/reseller-web-hosting/) |

## Security: What's Protecting Your Site

Every server sits behind DDoS protection. Shared and WordPress hosting get Imunify360 – a security suite that includes web application firewall, malware scanner, and brute-force protection.

Daily automatic backups for shared hosting. VPS and dedicated servers? You're responsible for your own backups, though you can purchase offsite backup storage starting at $16.89/month.

Free SSL certificates included with all plans. Not those sketchy self-signed ones – proper Let's Encrypt certificates that browsers trust.

## Support: The Real Test

24/7 ticket and email support. Live chat available 8 AM to 6 PM CET. Phone support is limited to dedicated server customers.

Real talk from users: response times are solid. Most tickets get answered within a few hours. The support staff actually knows their stuff instead of reading from scripts. One reviewer mentioned having issues with WHM license expiration and DNS setups – support walked them through everything without the usual runaround.

For VPS and dedicated servers, you can add managed services ($56.39 to $140.98/month) where their team handles server health, performance monitoring, and software updates. Worth it if you're not a Linux wizard.

## Performance: The Numbers That Matter

AltusHost maintains a 99.9% uptime guarantee across all services. Independent reviews show they actually deliver on this – one monitoring test recorded 100% uptime over a 30-day period.

Their network runs on redundant Cisco-powered infrastructure. Multiple Tier 3+ data centers mean if one location has issues, traffic can reroute. For European traffic, latency is excellent. Global audiences should consider pairing with a CDN (they support Cloudflare integration).

Speed tests consistently show good results, with LiteSpeed and SSD storage giving shared hosting plans performance that rivals many VPS offerings from budget providers.

## The Money Situation: Pricing and Guarantees

Let's be honest – AltusHost isn't competing on price. Shared hosting at €9/month is higher than Hostinger's €1.99 bargain basement pricing. But here's what you're paying for:

- Your own hardware, not recycled resources from a megaprovider
- Support that responds in hours, not days
- Data centers you can actually visit (if you're in Europe)
- GDPR compliance without jumping through hoops

**Money-back guarantees:**
- Shared hosting: 45 days (50% longer than industry standard)
- VPS hosting: 14 days
- Dedicated servers: None (but this is standard industry-wide)

**Payment options:** Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, wire transfer, AliPay, and cryptocurrency accepted.

All prices exclude EU VAT, which gets added at checkout based on your location.

## Current Promotions and Discounts (2026)

AltusHost occasionally offers promotional codes. Based on recent data, typical discounts include:

- Up to 25% off on VPS hosting plans
- 20% recurring discounts on business web hosting
- Free setup on new dedicated servers
- Special pricing during Black Friday (up to 80% off shared hosting)

**Pro tip:** Discounts usually apply to the first billing period only. Renewals are at standard pricing. If you're planning long-term, choosing annual or biennial billing upfront locks in better rates.

## Who Should Choose AltusHost?

**Perfect for:**
- European businesses that need GDPR-compliant hosting
- Companies serving European audiences (latency matters)
- Anyone tired of oversold shared hosting with terrible support
- Agencies managing multiple client sites
- Developers who need reliable infrastructure and actual control

**Maybe skip if:**
- You're on a shoestring budget and just need basic WordPress hosting
- Your audience is primarily in Asia or North America (though they perform fine globally)
- You need Windows-based shared hosting (they focus on Linux)

## Data Centers and Infrastructure

Five strategic European locations:
- **Amsterdam, Netherlands:** Primary hub, excellent connectivity across Europe
- **Stockholm, Sweden:** Low latency for Scandinavian traffic
- **Zurich, Switzerland:** Premium tier facility, ideal for finance and healthcare
- **Sofia, Bulgaria:** Cost-effective option with solid performance
- **Belgrade, Serbia:** Expanding Eastern European presence

Each data center operates in private suites or cages with controlled access. Unlike many providers, AltusHost doesn't just rent rack space – they maintain dedicated infrastructure at each location.

## The Verdict: Worth It?

If you want the absolute cheapest hosting on planet Earth, look elsewhere. But if you value reliability, data sovereignty, and support that doesn't make you regret your life choices, AltusHost delivers.

The 45-day money-back guarantee on shared hosting gives you plenty of time to test their service. For VPS and dedicated servers, the 14-day window is tight but standard for the industry.

Real customer experiences skew positive. Common themes in reviews: excellent uptime, responsive support, premium infrastructure. Main complaint: pricing is higher than budget alternatives. But as one long-time customer put it: "There are cheaper alternatives, but then you get what you pay for."

## Getting Started with AltusHost

Ready to give them a shot? Here's the smart approach:

1. Start with business web hosting if you're running standard websites
2. Choose annual billing for better pricing
3. Take advantage of the 45-day guarantee – actually test their performance and support
4. Scale up to VPS when your traffic demands it (their migration service makes this painless)

The company offers free website migration, so switching from your current host won't require downtime or technical gymnastics.

## Bottom Line

AltusHost occupies a sweet spot: premium enough to deliver consistent performance and support, but not enterprise-priced. Since 2008, they've built their reputation on controlling their infrastructure, supporting their customers, and serving the European market better than global megahosts ever could.

The slightly higher pricing buys you infrastructure you can depend on, support that actually helps, and peace of mind that your data stays in GDPR-compliant European facilities. For businesses where uptime and reliability matter more than shaving €5 off your monthly bill, that's a trade worth making.
